It's finally Spring proper! Even though the weather outside might say otherwise. What's going on at Foulab? Something new, as usual. Come explore this month's selection of things for a local hacker to do.


### Cleaning day + FOULAB Monthly Meeting - Saturday April 6th @ 10:00 - 19:00

The time has come! Let's get together and give the space a clean so big it lasts a year, if not more. Everyone is welcome to attend - it's a commonly known fact that doing something good with others energizes like nothing else.

Starting from 3PM, we plan to take a break for a FOULAB meeting. Topics of discussion are logistics - and at last, the unveiling of the grand museum project. Do come by - even if you're not an active Foulaber!

### Sunday Mesh Morning - Sunday April 7th @ 09:00 - 12:00

A brief, low-key event with FOULAB's mesh networking enthusiasts hosted by **kryma**. Come play with OpenWRT hardware and learn about Montreal's WiFi mesh projects - from [Reseau Libre](https://wiki.reseaulibre.ca) to [KULUPU](https://kulupu.io) to our little in-house Bobcat chatbot.

<br/>

### Wiki Night - Thursday April 11th @ 19:00 - 20:30

Ever wondered what the lab was originally built around? Ever wanted to go for a dive deep into the space's history?

FOULAB's infrastructure specialist **eigma** shows and tells about the layers of the newly reconstructed FOULAB wiki. Come join - both readers and writers welcome.

<br/>

### Killed by Dice Presents: Mothership Returns - Sunday April 21st @ 16:00 - 19:00

Our tabletop friends at [Killed by Dice](https://killedbydice.com), led by **der_moderne_man**, bring you another fantastic roleplay event. This time, we're returning to the cold space and dark halls of Mothership - a terrifying science fiction RPG that will see you battling horrors among the unblinking stars. As usual, [please register on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mothership-science-fiction-horror-role-playing-tickets-878639944727) if you'd like to join - spots are limited!

<br/>

### FOULAB Project Night - Thursday April 25th @ 19:30 - 21:30

It's the event everyone's been waiting for! A chance to show off your coolest and most ingenious projects of the month, or to admire the ones brought by others. Join a celebration of the hacker spirit, hosted by none other than Mr. X of Foulab himself - the executive member **idefix**. Bring your own project if you want to show it. Don't have one? You're welcome to come look, too.

<br/>

*A special mention also goes out to our friends at [OSHWA](https://2024.oshwa.org/) - a summit for open hardware artists and hobbyists taking place just next month in Montreal. Come give them a visit - the lineup features plenty of clever hardware hacks that are sure to be a delight.*
