September... the month of going back to school, the month of Labour Day. And what's a better way to learn, and to honour the power of your labour, than to work on a project at FOULAB?

Here's what the locals have been cooking up:

### Demonstration of Resilient Infrastructure Through Open Sessions (aka Infrastructure Night) - Tuesday September 10th @ 20:00 - 20:30

Infrastructure nights are back!

FOULAB's Infrastructure Nights are small, bite-sized lectures and workshops on Foulab's internal IT infrastructure - how it works, how to use it, and how to fix things that inevitably go wrong in it.

This time, **eigma** is showing us the internal workings of [bahamut.lab](http://bahamut.lab) - Foulab's internal dead drop storage. Learn how to use a public resource here for you, learn how it is set up - maybe get a few ideas for a storage system of your own!

<br/>

### Sunday Mesh Morning - Wednesday September 11th @ 19:00 - 22:00

Mesh networking? Yessir. Routers? Yessir. Sunday morning? It's a little bit more complex this time.

The Sunday Mesh Morning is a Wednesday evening event dedicated to mesh networking in all its forms. From discussing it, researching and testing alternative network topologies, to practical exercises in deploying peer-to-peer infrastructure in FOULAB and around it.

**kryma** is hosting - join us, and you'll be hosting too. (Haha, decentralized joke - get it?)

<br/>

### Warhammer Night 4 - Tuesday September 17th @ 20:00 - 22:00

Time for another Warhammer night! Last month, we were stretching the definitions and learned that Zoids and Warhammer blend together better than expected.

Warhammer Nights are a recurring event dedicated to the Warhammer series, and similar strategic tabletop wargames that we play over the course of an open night.

Fighters and strategists, **der_moderne_man** calls upon you - we're having another deathmatch this month. Bring your army, or borrow a veteran's.

<br/>

### FOULAB Monthly Meeting - Thursday September 19th @ 20:00 - 21:30

Meeting meeting! We are hanging out, eating pizza, and discussing important FOULAB things. Things like new ACs (yay!). Things like the new more compact biolab! Things like optimizing the cans system and other chores!

This public night will have a special time slot for an organizational meeting. Join us to talk about FOULAB - make your voice heard on things that matter most.

<br/>

### Killed by Dice Presents: Three Sixteen II - Sunday September 29th @ 16:00 - 19:00

Three Sixteen is back! A playful riff on Starship Troopers as a tabletop RPG lets you kill all the space bugs you need. A dinosaur can be a space bug, we learned last time - who knows what else lies ahead.

Killed by Diodes is a regular collaboration between the NDG tabletop roleplaying group [Killed by Dice](https://killedbydice.com) and FOULAB. RSVP to join us for a monthly open game - slots are limited.

This time, **der_moderne_man** invites you to take the charge blasting aliens - drop in for three hours of sci-fi action!
