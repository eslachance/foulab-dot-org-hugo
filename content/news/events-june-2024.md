June has come - and with it, the summer has started! Feeling the heat yet? That's a fantastic new month the lab is cooking up.


### Sunday Mesh Morning III - Sunday June 5th @ 10:00 - 13:00

An ongoing exploration of mesh networking and decentralized infrastructure hosted by none other than **kryma** and the team.  

Come join the crew - get mesh networking software on your laptop, and maybe even set a piece of lab infrastructure up!

### Warhammer Night - Tuesday June 11th @ 19:00 - 21:00

A community of Warhammer enthusiasts is slowly assembling at Foulab. Seems those minis are just irresistible, huh?

Come join **der_moderne_man**'s charge to secure a little event for the tiny plastic soldier appreciators. 3D prints and plamods welcome!

### Wiki Night - Tuesday June 18th @ 20:00 - 20:30

The Wiki Night has been going great! Last time, we were connecting isolated pages to the main Foulab wiki graph. Want to do some documentation in a cool way? Join our documentation overlord **eigma** for the most fun 30 minutes you can have with a community-run encyclopedia.

<br/>

### Demonstration of Resilient Infrastructure Through Open Sessions (aka Infrastructure Night) - Tuesday June 25th @ 20:00 - 22:00

One system administrator is too little for a big thing like Foulab. You can be a system administrator, too! Join **eigma** and a few other interested parties as we train green rookies and pros alike to become hardened hackerspace maintainers.

<br/>

*Another event is to be announced later in the month.*
