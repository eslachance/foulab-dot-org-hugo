Hi, all.

The more involved of you may remember that insuring the lab, and keeping it insured, is no easy task. This time, to keep rates manageable, our partner organization has required us to re-evaluate our public image. From now on, we have been asked to refrain from using a certain term that describes illegal cybersecurity bypassing. This term is banned from our Mattermost starting now; we are working on updating the site content.

The rest of the Fablab experience is not expected to change much. It's still a makerspace, so you'll be able to build projects, hang out, and socialize with your peers just like before.

Have a nice spring, everyone!
