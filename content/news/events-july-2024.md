<br/>

July's come, and 2024 is half over already! Got anything planned for this year? Do it! At FOULAB.

### Fan Wiki Night - Tuesday July 2nd @ 20:00 - 20:30

Another wiki night! **eigma** is leading the party only in spirit - let's band together and self-organize to get our internal encyclopedia all dressed up nice and clean.

It's good when the documentation is good and relevant - let's save FOULAB by making sure it stays that way.

<br/>

### Sunday Mesh Morning IV - Sunday July 7th @ 10:00 - 13:00

**kryma** and the mesh network team invite you to get funky with your networking once again. Sunday Mesh Morning IV straight into your veins - don't miss the opportunity!

This month, featuring FOULAB websites getting on the mesh and the jankiest mobile data plan that has ever grazed Montreal.

### Warhammer Night Strikes Back - Thursday July 11th @ 19:00 - 21:00

Warhammer nights are getting into full swing. Some official, some ad-hoc - they say running a little plastic army every once in a while is the best treat you can get.

**der_moderne_man** and the team are hosting again. Come join us, we're military generals out there.

<br/>

### FOULAB Monthly Meeting - Tuesday July 16th @ 20:00 - 22:00

Meeting meeting! During a public night nonetheless. Let's shake the formula up a little.

Come and discuss the new Internet plan, museum progress, and anything else that's been happening around the lab that you may want to bring up. Decisions will be made, pizza will be had!

<br/>

### Demonstration of Resilient Infrastructure Through Open Sessions (aka Infrastructure Night) - Tuesday July 23rd @ 20:00 - 22:00

Another outage has happened at Foulab! Or will happen. Let's join **eigma** and the ministry of infrastructure, and butt our heads together to fix a difficult problem surgically implanted into the lab's network.

What a good way to learn about system administration, and its specifics at our space. Problems being fixed by hackers - you love to see it. Problems being fixed by you - you'll love to do it.

<br/>

### F0UL4B HACKERSPACE PROJECT NIGHT - Thursday July 25th @ 20:00 - 22:00

Three months have passed, and it's time for *ANOTHER PROJECT NIGHT!*

You've been hacking away and making a sick new prototype you're eager to share with FOULAB? You've been interested in what a hackerspace actually does? 'Tis the day for demos - come get your fill.

Over two hours, watch people's pet projects get proudly presented, or join yourself to demonstrate a device you've developed. Perfect celebration of hacker culture - and of all the new inventions too!

Hosted by an **old friend of Foulab**, this event is sure to be a blast.
