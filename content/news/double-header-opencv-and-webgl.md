<div style="text-align: center; color: red; margin-bottom: 20px;">POSTPONED DUE TO LACK OF SIGNUPS</div>

<s>Nov 2 and 3</s> Postponed, Foulab will present two workshops. On Saturday, learn to bring visual interaction to your projects with Introduction to computer vision with OpenCV, and on Sunday, step up to modern graphics in your web applications with Introduction to WebGL. Each workshop will run from 13:00h to 17:00h. Workshop attendance is $30 each, or $50 to attend both workshops. Each workshop is limited to 20 places, so get 'em while they're hot.  
  
[Tickets are for sale on eventbrite](https://opencvandwebgl.eventbrite.ca/) Each event alone is 30$, or 50$ to attend both.  
  
The workshop presentations will be in English, but we are more than happy to provide support and answer questions in French.

## INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER VISION WITH OPENCV  
Do you want to make your computer react to light, movement and gestures? Do you want to capture and process images and video as part of your project? Do you wonder: whats wrong with these lazy AI programmers, why can't my computer recognize me yet? Get answers to all these questions and more at the Foulab Workshop “Introduction to computer vision with OpenCV”!  
  
The workshop is aimed at people with some programming knowledge, but not necessarily any computer vision knowledge. We will cover:  
  
* how to install and set up the Open Computer Vision toolkit,
* an introduction to computer vision algorithms,
* a couple interactive OpenCV demonstrations that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.
  
  
The primary programming language for the workshop will be Python. The workshop has been updated from previous workshops to cover OpenCV 2.4.6, and the latest version of OpenCV's python interface.  
  
<s>Time: Saturday, November 2, 1-5pm</s> Postponed  
__Required materials: laptop, webcam__  
  
While this workshop will be limited in scope to OpenCV itself, people are encouraged to stay after the workshop and discuss more advanced topics, such as the interfacing of openCV with other libraries and languages. If you have projects in mind or in progress, please do stick around and chat with us!  
  
## INTRODUCTION TO WEBGL  
Long gone are the days of simple text tickers and epileptic shock inducing blink tags.These days we see javascript as a fast growing multimedia oriented language, and the jump to 3D is now at the cutting edge of competing with your native desktop application with WebGL.  
  
In collaboration with Montreal's very own demoparty, RECURSION, and it's hackerspace, Foulab, we are happy to present an introduction to the modern OpenGL 3D processing pipeline through OpenGL.  
  
Building off certain image processing concepts presented in the OpenCV workshop, we will give you an introduction to the following concepts so that you may start programming your own 3D demoes.  
  
We will go over a number of small things specific to basic demo making including: setting up the rendering pipeline, in addition to explaining its internals. Simple examples of procedural rendering. As well as an overview of how this can go on to be applied to OpenGL in general.  
  
<s>Time: Sunday, November 3rd, 1-5pm</s>  
__Required materials: laptop, chrome__  
  
Please be advised that a working knowledge of basic linear algebra will be required, in addition to that of programming.
