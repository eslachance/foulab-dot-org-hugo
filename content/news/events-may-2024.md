May is upon us! Let's start with a big announcement.


## FOULAB Does Gamedev v1 - a month-long SMBX level design collab

With support of four generous sponsors, we are launching a month-long platformer game collab fest.

Your goal is simple. Make a level for a classic platformer game, the first work of the famous indie developer Redigit, Super Mario Bros. X.

You can download the game [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/40771). (A faithful Linux port with a lesser editor is available [here](https://wohlsoft.ru/projects/TheXTech/), and a fan-made continuation lives on [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/504076) )

Why make a level? Well, it has been agreed that for every unique Foulaber that makes a level\*, **each of the sponsors will pitch in $5 to the lab - a total of $20**. Twenty dollars - and your mark on a grand piece of Foulab art. Want to support the space and flex your creative muscles in the meantime? Get making! Don't want to do that? Get your friends making! We are situated in the ~UUDDLRLRBAStart channel in Mattermost.

*(\*donation extends up to a maximum of 20 participants involved)*

The work will be released as a collab album later in the year.

### Intro workshop for FOULAB Does Gamedev v1 - Tuesday May 7th @ 19:30 - 21:00

How do I join **Foulab Does Gamedev**? Can I make a level, too? What's a mario?

Let's answer those questions together - drop by our space with a laptop for a quick run-through of how to install the collab game, how to navigate the gameplay and the editor controls, and even how to make a small level yourself! Any OS welcome.
