October is here! We're open every Tuesday and Thursday, 6:30 PM to 11 PM. Do I need to say more?

Of course I do. Take a look at some of the wonderful things going on at Foulab:

### Wednesday Mesh Evening - Wednesday October 9th @ 19:00 - 22:00

The mesh effort returns on the 9th - we will be dissecting a highly directional router, and working on a Tor proxy.

The ~~Sunday~~ Wednesday Mesh ~~Morning~~ Evening is a Wednesday evening event dedicated to mesh networking in all its forms. From discussing it, researching and testing alternative network topologies, to practical exercises in deploying peer-to-peer infrastructure in FOULAB and around it.

Hosted by **kryma** as usual, this is a fantastic entry point for all your mesh networking interests. Bring your own mesh, or join one of our ongoing experiments!

### Warhammer Night 5 - Tuesday October 15th @ 20:00 - 22:00

Warhammer Night returns, looking for new and recurring players alike! Who would win - ten cowboy ninjas or one giant robot? Join us in the most practical way to resolve the old playground question.

Warhammer Nights are a recurring event dedicated to the Warhammer series, and similar strategic tabletop wargames that we play over the course of an open night.

Another fight is brewing - **der_moderne_man** invites you to participate!

### Creative Recycling: Making Art with Scrap Material - Saturday October 19th & Monday October 21st @ 19:00 - 22:00

Miss Creative Recycling yet? The team's back, and ready to teach you how to empty your trash bin in the most unconventional ways. Put your plastic bottles to good use, get your Halloween costume going!

Creative Recycling is a semi-recurring workshop that shows how to creatively incorporate refuse plastic and aluminum into aesthetically pleasing sculpture. The workshop is entry level - students with no previous experience are welcome to attend.

Local cyberpunk and independent artist **stuntman** invites you to join him for two evenings of sculpture again. Come by and learn from experience - anyone can make something beautiful.

### FOULAB Monthly Meeting - Tuesday October 22nd @ 20:00 - 21:30

Last meeting, we discussed a lot of potential improvements in the space - from problems with the communal sink to the ongoing resurfacing of the main tables. Those problems are being worked on as we speak - show up on the day to hear the latest updates, and maybe bring something up yourself!

This public night will have a special time slot for an organizational meeting. Join us to talk about FOULAB - make your voice heard on things that matter most.

### FOULAB BIRTHDAY / HALLOWEEN PARTY - Thursday October 24th @ 18:30 - 23:00

Imagine a world without hackerspaces. Spooky, eh? Let's have two celebrations about this. Let's host them at the same time too.

FOULAB will be hosting a party in honour of both Halloween, and its 16th birthday! Bring a good mood and whatever food can help make it better, and let's have fun celebrating another year of this du College warehouse we've all grown to love.

(And ghosts or something.)

### Killed by Dice Presents: Three Sixteen III - Sunday October 27th @ 16:00 - 19:00

The Three Sixteen tour continues to the next planet. While the players are having a blast killing all sorts of new and exciting aliens, their characters are pitted against some serious threats to their well-being. Human weaknesses are uncovered, political plays at the coveted Lieutenant rank begin - oh the intrigue!

This is a regular collaboration between the NDG tabletop roleplaying group [Killed by Dice](https://killedbydice.com) and FOULAB. RSVP to join us for a monthly open game - slots are limited.

**der_moderne_man** wants YOU to serve Earth - will you be joining?
