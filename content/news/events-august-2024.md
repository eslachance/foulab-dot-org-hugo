<center><i>Warhammer Night at FOULAB</i></center>

<br/>

August already? Time sure flies when you are having FOULAB. Let's have more - here is how to do it.

### Wiki Night - Tuesday August 6th @ 20:00 - 20:30

**eigma** is inviting us all once again to gather round, have a glass of fizzy water, and edit FOULAB's history in real time.

Last month, it was the Wiki night fan club gathering together to look at polls and blogs - a month before that, we were editing orphaned pages back into the wiki graph. What will it be now? Join us for the precisely timed 30 minutes and find out!

<br/>

### Sunday Mesh Morning V - Sunday August 11th @ 10:00 - 13:00

The mesh networking sessions return! Join **kryma** and friends in making a new, hyper-local version of the Internet - where all the world is accessible from your PC, as long as your idea of the world is limited to the Saint Henri neighbourhood of Montreal.

Sunday stands for a pleasant day outside, Mesh stands for new friends and a new network, and Morning stands for having something to wake up early for. What does V stand for? Vendetta, of course.

<br/>

### Warhammer Night 3 - Tuesday August 13th @ 20:00 - 22:00

This evening, Warhammer rides again! Security briefcases chock-full of little plastic miniatures and a session of intense large-scale combat await you. Bring a hand-painted army or borrow one from the locals, and make your enemies pay.

**der_moderne_man** returns in the leading role, to put together a crew. Prepare for an unforgettable evening.

<br/>

### FOULAB Monthly Meeting - Tuesday August 20th @ 20:00 - 21:00

Another public night meeting? Last month, so many new faces were involved - and the reception was fantastic. Let's do it again.

Show up during this public night to discuss FOULAB's goings on, the new users, the projects going on at the space. Let's all celebrate the lab, talk business, and maybe grab a pizza later.

<br/>

### Hydroponics 101: Intro to the Kratky method - Thursday August 22nd @ 20:00 - 21:00

It's been a while since we had a quick rundown on the basics of hydroponic methods. Perhaps it's high time to do it again. And what's a better way to learn hydroponics from the Farmer of FOULAB himself, the user **tlot**?

Dead simple, our tech-agriculture instructor says. Put a seed in the water, make the water right, and you'll get salad for days - no maintenance at all! Join us for an explanation. **Recommended donation - $10 CAD.**

<br/>

### FouLAN Party - Saturday August 24th @ 19:00 - 23:00

FOULAB's gaming collective comes together for another evening! The Mario fans from this spring are ready to present the assembled collection, and the FPS aficionados are itching for a proper party.

Unreal Tournament is on the docket, our host **nintendoeats** promises, and they say some of the players coming are pretty damn good. Knock them down a notch - or get taught the real meaning of the word "1337".


<br/>

### Demonstration of Resilient Infrastructure Through Open Sessions (aka Infrastructure Night) - Tuesday August 27th @ 20:00 - 22:00

Another infrastructure night! This night's theme, **the new Internet.** Not the Sunday Mesh Morning type - we are changing our ISP and would like some input.

<br/>

### Quiz Night: Back to School Edition - Wednesday August 28th @ 19:00 - 22:00

August is coming close to an end, everybody! Summer break is over, school's back in. You know what that means - time to study for the test.

Come join a fantastic game evening prepared by the Foulab professor **kida** - show off your knowledge of all sorts of facts about hackers and hacking in the form of a Montreal-renowned FOULAB quiz, coming back this Wednesday evening.
